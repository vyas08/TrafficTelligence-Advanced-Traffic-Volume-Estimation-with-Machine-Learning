# 🚦 TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning

![Banner](https://github.com/harika1807/TrafficTelligence_Advanced_Traffic_Volume_Estimation_with_Machine_Learning/blob/main/TrafficTelligence_Banner.png)

**TrafficTelligence** is a machine learning-based web application that predicts traffic volume using environmental and temporal data. By leveraging historical patterns, it provides accurate traffic forecasts to support smart traffic control, urban planning, and commuter decision-making.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traffic congestion is a pressing issue in urban areas. There is a growing need for predictive systems that can anticipate traffic volume and support:
- Dynamic traffic signal management
- Infrastructure development planning
- Smarter commuter navigation

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze traffic datasets and identify key influencing features
- Train and evaluate machine learning models to estimate traffic volume
- Build a web-based interface for real-time traffic volume prediction

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features like:
- **Holiday**: Whether the day is a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **Temperature** (°C)
- **Rain** (mm)
- **Snow** (mm)
- **Date & Time** (used to extract Year, Month, Day, Hour)
- **Target**: `Traffic_volume` (number of vehicles)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning

### 🔍 Features
- Numerical and categorical preprocessing
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Missing value imputation with `SimpleImputer`

### 🛠️ Models Used
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics
| Model            | R² Score | RMSE    |
|------------------|----------|---------|
| Random Forest    | **0.8489** | **772.73** |
| XGBoost          | 0.8433   | 787.06  |

✅ **Random Forest** was selected for deployment due to higher R² and lower RMSE.
